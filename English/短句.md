## Dad Was Right： 姜是老的辣/不听老人言，吃亏在眼前
Like most children I ignored my father's advice, given years ago, that I should read this book. At age 45 I picked it up and can see Dad was (once again) right and I was wrong. Some of these ideas will sound familiar to you because you may already practice them. Old ideas like personal integrity, connecting with people on a thoughtful and personal level, being able to admit your mistakes, being forthright, candid and authentic in your dealings and being actually interested in people and what they want (instead of just what you want!) are powerful and timeless. Read this book with an open mind, noting that it is an old book and the references are from a man's world of old - but the principles apply to all genders. I apply these concepts to my law practice every day and find they have increased my income and grown my referral network. Put this one on your shelf, it is worth the subscription price.
