The Audible Essentials is our list of 100 absolute must-listens. Hours were spent deliberating which books should (and shouldn't) make the cut. Ultimately, the final list was chosen to represent a wide range of genres, compelling stories, and can't-miss performances. These are the books that stand the test of time: vetted by our listeners and hand-picked by our editors as examples of excellence.

## 1. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

Book 1
By: J.K. Rowling
Narrated by: Jim Dale
Series: Wizarding World, Book 1, Harry Potter, Book 1
Length: 8 hrs and 33 mins
Release date: 11-20-15
     5 out of 5 stars76,519 ratings

推荐理由：
I grew up with Harry Potter. We were the same age throughout most of the books, and in a way the publication of Book 7 marked the end of my own childhood. This rich world that J.K. Rowling created still feels like home to me, and I don’t know that there will ever be another series that will touch me in the same way. I only recently listened to the books, and it was so special to experience Hogwarts in a new way. Jim Dale’s award-winning performance of the series is impressive and awe-inspiring (and includes a Guinness World Record for the 134 voices he created in Order of the Phoenix). —Katie, Audible Editor

## 2. A Game of Thrones

A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1
By: George R. R. Martin
Narrated by: Roy Dotrice
Series: A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1
Length: 33 hrs and 46 mins
Release date: 12-09-03
     4.5 out of 5 stars100,770 ratings

推荐理由：
In late 2011, George R. R. Martin visited Audible and described the constraints of his former career as a scriptwriter; TV’s episodic structure dictated that every story needed to end neatly after a certain amount of time. The limits on his creativity drove him to novel-writing, where the story can be as big and messy as it wants to be. A Game of Thrones isn’t just an unabridged audiobook, it’s an unabridged imagination. —Christina, Audible Editor

## 3. Born a Crime
Stories from a South African Childhood
By: Trevor Noah
Narrated by: Trevor Noah
Length: 8 hrs and 44 mins
Release date: 11-15-16
     5 out of 5 stars113,342 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
If I could recommend only one audiobook in our store, it would—without a doubt—be Trevor Noah’s Born a Crime. This is so much more than a celebrity memoir; it’s an unexpectedly heart-wrenching coming-of-age story of Noah’s childhood in apartheid-afflicted South Africa. Noah, forced by circumstance to be a chameleon of cultures, provides rich texture and nuance with his witty and unparalleled delivery (his multilingual abilities ensure that). Tears of despair, victory, and laughter soaked my face each time I listened to this life-changing and surprisingly uplifting story. —Jess, Audible Editor

## 4. The Martian

By: Andy Weir
Narrated by: R. C. Bray
Length: 10 hrs and 53 mins
Release date: 03-22-13
     5 out of 5 stars162,138 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
From its humble self-published debut to its adaptation into a blockbuster film, The Martian has pretty much become an all-around sci-fi essential. And yet I can't help but feel that you haven't truly experienced this phenomenon until you've listened to R. C. Bray embody Mark Watney in all his sarcastic, quick-witted glory. When someone asks me how they should experience The Martian for the first time—in book form, film, or audio—my answer is always, always audio. —Sam, Audible Editor

## 5. Ready Player One

By: Ernest Cline
Narrated by: Wil Wheaton
Length: 15 hrs and 40 mins
Release date: 08-16-11
     5 out of 5 stars210,889 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
You’d be hard-pressed to find a narrator more apt to perform Ernest Cline’s 80s-pop-culture-reference-heavy adventure than Wil Wheaton, who lends his sci-fi credibility to the imagined video game world in which most of the novel takes place. Leaning heavily on the films and music that helped define a decade, Ready Player One is a satisfying, high-intensity journey full of “impossible” puzzles, innumerable enemies, and the occasional cheat code. —Chris, Audible Editor

## 6. A Man Called Ove

By: Fredrik Backman
Narrated by: George Newbern
Length: 9 hrs and 9 mins
Release date: 12-29-13
     4.5 out of 5 stars64,006 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
When a quiet and lovey work of fiction took over our collective office conscience with the intensity of a blow-your-mind thriller, we knew there was something special going on. For weeks Ove—a sad but uplifting tale about a heartbroken and aging man who is redeemed by the power of friendship—was all we could talk about and recommend. We weren’t expecting it to be so gripping, but this book is just that good. —Emily, Audible Editor

## 7. The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition

By: Margaret Atwood, Valerie Martin - essay
Narrated by: Claire Danes, full cast, Margaret Atwood
Series: The Handmaid's Tale, Book 1
Length: 12 hrs and 6 mins
Release date: 04-04-17
     4.5 out of 5 stars25,244 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Full disclosure: The Handmaid's Tale is my favorite book. So when it was finally produced in audio, I was ready—like a fan girl clutching a movie ticket on opening night—to be let down. I was worried that no narrator could live up to my expectations, but Claire Danes is perfect. She doesn't act, and she doesn't need to. She recounts. She breathes out Offred’s tale as if she is living it. Resigned, beaten down, traveling through hell by putting one step ahead of the other. —Emily, Audible Editor

## 8. Outlander

Outlander, Book 1
By: Diana Gabaldon
Narrated by: Davina Porter
Series: Outlander, Book 1
Length: 32 hrs and 38 mins
Release date: 07-13-06
     4.5 out of 5 stars54,580 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Outlander. Just the single word conveys so many things to fans: epic love story. Sexy accents. Time travel. Adventure. And one cannot think of Diana Gabaldon’s series without also thinking of its narrator, Davina Porter. Across hundreds and hundreds of hours of audio, she has remained consistent in her performance of Claire, Jamie, and 18th century highlanders galore. If you’re new to the series settle in for the long haul: Davina and her accents are addicting. —Katie, Audible Editor

## 9. Gone Girl

A Novel
By: Gillian Flynn
Narrated by: Julia Whelan, Kirby Heyborne
Length: 19 hrs and 11 mins
Release date: 06-05-12
     4.5 out of 5 stars49,863 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Gone Girl is a disturbingly satisfying book that will forever stick in the back of my mind. Phenomenally popular in print and even better in audio, it’s the kind of thriller everyone should listen to, even if you don't think of yourself as a fan of the genre. Narrators Julia Whelan and Kirby Heyborne (my new favorites) bring Amy and Nick Dunne to life, placing Gone Girl at the top on my list of the best multi-narrator performances out there. —Tricia, Audible Editor

## 10. Bossypants

By: Tina Fey
Narrated by: Tina Fey
Length: 5 hrs and 32 mins
Release date: 04-05-11
     4.5 out of 5 stars50,659 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Witty, finely crafted, and meant to be heard, Tina Fey’s Bossypants set the bar (notably, quite high) on what we’ve come to expect from a celebrity comedian’s memoir. Fey knows how to deliver a good punchline—and does so hilariously throughout this half-memoir, half-stand-up routine. From her days in the Second City comedy troupe, to Saturday Night Live, to Hollywood, these stories will leave you in stitches, while offering an intimate glimpse into what it took for Fey to rise to the top. —Jess, Audible Editor

## 11. Steve Jobs

By: Walter Isaacson
Narrated by: Dylan Baker
Length: 25 hrs and 18 mins
Release date: 10-24-11
     4.5 out of 5 stars25,520 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Dylan Baker’s narration of Steve Jobs is wonderful—heartfelt, factual, and brisk, just like the prose. When he realized he might die shortly, Steve Jobs called upon Walter Isaacson to record the real truth of Jobs’s life for the Jobs children. Isaacson manages to sketch Jobs as a mere mortal and also a titan of tech. Isaacson and Baker both use irony gently and to great effect in the portrayal of a once-in-a-lifetime visionary with outsize flaws. —Christina, Audible Editor

## 12. We Are Legion (We Are Bob)

Bobiverse, Book 1
By: Dennis E. Taylor
Narrated by: Ray Porter
Series: Bobiverse, Book 1
Length: 9 hrs and 31 mins
Release date: 09-20-16
     4.5 out of 5 stars67,508 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
If you’re going to spend eternity traveling the universe, you may as well do it with narrator Ray Porter. Anything you need, he’s got. He’s eminently likable as the story’s level-headed, problem-solving hero, Bob, a sentient space probe sent into the void on humanity’s behalf. At the same time, Porter shows off a mind-boggling array of other personalities and voices as Bob’s ever-multiplying and increasingly distinct clones—and makes you care about each and every one. —David, Audible Editor

## 13. 11-22-63

A Novel
By: Stephen King
Narrated by: Craig Wasson
Length: 30 hrs and 40 mins
Release date: 11-08-11
     4.5 out of 5 stars50,405 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Stephen King is a master storyteller in his genre, and 11-22-63 is one of those rare gems of a book that has a little something for everybody—history, action, mystery, sci-fi, horror, and romance. Despite the range of literary interests on our team, every editor who has listened has absolutely loved it. With a masterful, untiring performance from Craig Wasson, this book will forever be one of my most recommended in audio. —Sam, Audible Editor

## 14. Unbroken

A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption
By: Laura Hillenbrand
Narrated by: Edward Herrmann
Length: 13 hrs and 56 mins
Release date: 11-16-10
     4.5 out of 5 stars40,739 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
“Unbelievable” is a common reaction to Unbroken, Laura Hillenbrand’s true story of the life of Louis Zamperini, whose journey home after being shot down in the Pacific theater of World War II is filled with one more seemingly impossible circumstance after another. Narrator Edward Herrmann brings gravitas and empathy in equal measure, from Louis’s time as a track star to his survival in a life raft, and from his time spent in a prison camp to his eventual journey home. Louis’s ingenuity and strength of character is a true inspiration, and Herrmann’s performance makes this one impossible to turn off. —Chris, Audible Editor

## 15. To Kill a Mockingbird

By: Harper Lee
Narrated by: Sissy Spacek
Length: 12 hrs and 17 mins
Release date: 07-08-14
     5 out of 5 stars27,167 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Sissy Spacek’s clear-as-a-bell Southern lilt immediately places you in young Scout Finch’s world, primed and ready for Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning story of Southern injustice and what it means to exercise a moral imperative to seek justice. Just as the book remains a perennial best seller, this audiobook is worth revisiting again and again. —Abby, Audible Editor

## 16. The Help

By: Kathryn Stockett
Narrated by: Jenna Lamia, Bahni Turpin, Octavia Spencer, Cassandra Campbell
Length: 18 hrs and 16 mins
Release date: 12-28-08
     5 out of 5 stars38,063 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
The Help was the first book I listened to when I started working at Audible, so there is some nostalgia to my selecting it as an essential. At the same time, I picked it because it was the book everyone told me I just had to experience in audio. And it’s true: The Help, with stand-out performances by Bahni Turpin, Jenna Lamia, and Octavia Spencer, brilliantly showcases the power of a well-cast, multi-voice performance. It stands as one of the best examples of audio truly elevating an already-powerful book. —Tricia, Audible Editor

## 17. Invisible Man

A Novel
By: Ralph Ellison
Narrated by: Joe Morton
Length: 18 hrs and 36 mins
Release date: 12-21-10
     4 out of 5 stars6,283 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Ralph Ellison’s novel is literally essential to Audible; our founder and CEO, Don Katz, studied with Ellison, and Ellison’s observations about American literature as an oral, vernacular form inspired Don’s ruminations about the rightful place of spoken-word entertainment in our society. Joe Morton’s performance matches the lyricism and improvisation of the text. This audiobook is a paradox: a story about isolation that—thoughtfully savored—can unite our society now. —Christina, Audible Editor

## 18. The Nightingale

By: Kristin Hannah
Narrated by: Polly Stone
Length: 17 hrs and 19 mins
Release date: 02-03-15
     5 out of 5 stars49,406 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
I have a weakness for books that make me ugly cry, and in my family The Nightingale has achieved legend status. As I sobbed, my husband had to remind me that the book wasn’t real. Kristin Hannah’s moving and heart-wrenching WWII epic follows two sisters as they fight against the Nazis in very different, but equally important ways. The Nightingale was Audible’s Best Book of 2015, and it remains one of my favorite books of all time. —Katie, Audible Editor

## 19. The Name of the Wind

(Kingkiller Chronicle, Book 1)
By: Patrick Rothfuss
Narrated by: Nick Podehl
Series: Kingkiller Chronicle, Book 1
Length: 27 hrs and 55 mins
Release date: 05-15-09
     4.5 out of 5 stars67,452 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
It’s incredible when you consider that this debut series, which consists of just two books (so far), made Patrick Rothfuss a household name, placing him on a list of fantasy masters that includes George R.R. Martin, Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, and more. But one listen will make that fact seem obvious—The Kingkiller Chronicles is everything that epic fantasy should be, and beloved series narrator Nick Podehl only builds upon that experience. —Sam, Audible Editor

## 20. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo

The Millennium Series, Book 1
By: Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland - translator
Narrated by: Simon Vance
Series: Millennium Series, Book 1
Length: 16 hrs and 19 mins
Release date: 09-16-08
     4.5 out of 5 stars35,356 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Sure, this is a great book with a phenomenal heroine, but set that aside—this is a truly special listen. Simon Vance’s delivery is that of a journalist letting you in on an incredible story over a beer, a perfect match for the author and material. He creates a range of subtly delineated voices for characters from all over Europe. And the way he pronounces Swedish names and places is so perfect, you’ll find yourself absentmindedly repeating them to yourself weeks after you finish listening. —David, Audible Editor

## 21. Ender's Game

Special 20th Anniversary Edition
By: Orson Scott Card
Narrated by: Stefan Rudnicki, Harlan Ellison, Gabrielle de Cuir
Series: Ender's Game, Book 1, The Enderverse, Book 5
Length: 11 hrs and 57 mins
Release date: 12-30-01
     4.5 out of 5 stars36,810 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
It’s really best to go into this one blind, but if you need more of a reason to listen to this sci-fi classic other than the fact that it’s a sci-fi classic for a great reason, chalk it up to this: Ender’s Game is a nonstop thrill ride of dynamic dialogue, space opera action, and big-picture philosophical concepts that don’t slow anything down. And the narrators are just as captivating as the timeless content. Right in line with the action and the characters, their sardonic, straightforward performances offer even greater depth to a story that is already so well-refined. —Michael, Audible Editor 

## 22. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

By: Douglas Adams
Narrated by: Stephen Fry
Series: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Book 1
Length: 5 hrs and 51 mins
Release date: 04-28-05
     4.5 out of 5 stars33,344 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Douglas Adams’s cheeky writing is right in the wheelhouse for narrator Stephen Fry, who nails one absurd gag after another with spot-on timing and impudence. He savors each character, shifting gears effortlessly among the put-out earthling Arthur Dent, zany intergalactic politician Zaphod Beeblebrox, and hilariously downbeat robot Marvin (“The Paranoid Android”). Forget the movie version—even a full cast of great actors can’t outdo Fry on this one. —David, Audible Editor

## 23. The Fault in Our Stars

By: John Green
Narrated by: Kate Rudd
Length: 7 hrs and 14 mins
Release date: 01-10-12
     4.5 out of 5 stars22,265 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
I’m fairly certain that if you’re not in tears at the end of John Green’s mega-best-selling novel, you might be dead inside. Green demonstrates through his characters that even as a teenager you can experience profound and life-altering love, and that a short life can still mean a great life. For me, Kate Reading’s performance made this book what it is. She conveys all of the angst and sadness and hope that live within the protagonist Hazel Grace Lancaster in such a vulnerable way that it feels more like a diary than a novel. —Katie, Audible Editor

## 24. The Great Gatsby

By: F. Scott Fitzgerald
Narrated by: Jake Gyllenhaal
Length: 4 hrs and 49 mins
Release date: 04-09-13
     4.5 out of 5 stars12,873 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
The Great Gatsby is undoubtedly an American classic, but Jake Gyllenhaal’s superb narration as Nick Carraway takes it to a whole new level. Fitzgerald’s elegant yet simple prose stands the test of time, and Gyllenhaal treats it with the utmost respect, allowing the vivid descriptions of mansions, landmarks, and 1920s New York to flow at just the right pace. While ultimately tragic, The Great Gatsby is full of light and beautiful moments that kindle nostalgia for the Roaring Twenties. —Chris, Audible Editor

## 25. The Undoing Project

A Friendship That Changed Our Minds
By: Michael Lewis
Narrated by: Dennis Boutsikaris
Length: 10 hrs and 18 mins
Release date: 12-06-16
     4.5 out of 5 stars10,100 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Michael Lewis is known for his accessible and incredibly interesting "backstage-pass looks" into the inner workings of a particular industry. In The Undoing Project (which is gunning for the top spot on my Michael Lewis Favorites list) that industry is behavioral economics . . . partially. The book is also about a friendship which completely revolutionized what is known as "Big Data.” Dennis Boutsikaris, with his clear and knowing voice, does an incredible job of highlighting the conversational tone Michael Lewis is famous for. —Laura, Audible Editor

## 26. The Goldfinch

By: Donna Tartt
Narrated by: David Pittu
Length: 32 hrs and 24 mins
Release date: 10-22-13
     4.5 out of 5 stars26,723 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
The Goldfinch is one of those rare books that makes me wish I could turn back time so I could experience it anew all over again. Epic in both narrative scope and in length, this heartbreaking and gripping coming-of-age story is simply destined to become a modern classic. Narrator David Pittu takes on the mammoth task of voicing Tartt’s captivating characters over years of growth, regression, and change; in the process, he creates a beautiful, familiar kinship with each character that resonates with the listener long after the final chapter. —Sam, Audible Editor

## 27. Me Before You

A Novel
By: Jojo Moyes
Narrated by: Susan Lyons, Anna Bentink, Steven Crossley, Alex Tregear, Andrew Wincott, Owen Lindsay
Series: Me Before You Trilogy, Book 1
Length: 14 hrs and 40 mins
Release date: 12-31-12
     4.5 out of 5 stars31,422 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
I think I fell in love with author Jojo Moyes as much as I did with Louisa and Will while listening to Me Before You. Her ability to make you feel so deeply for her characters is a true talent, and one that she consistently demonstrates in all of her work. This is a thought-provoking and beautiful book with a rich, multi-voiced cast that truly makes you think about the importance of being selfless in love. Fun Audible fact—we had team outing to the movies when the film came out. What’s more fun than hysterically sobbing in front of your coworkers? Nothing. —Katie, Audible Editor

## 28. Sherlock Holmes

By: Arthur Conan Doyle, Stephen Fry - introductions
Narrated by: Stephen Fry
Length: 62 hrs and 52 mins
Release date: 02-27-17
     5 out of 5 stars7,772 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
There is no detective more beloved than Sherlock Holmes, and this mammoth collection of four of Conan Doyle's Sherlock novels, plus four sets of short stories, is a must-listen for any fan of the mystery genre. It's narrated by the inimitable Stephen Fry, which is an appealing factor on its own, but what truly makes this listen special is Fry's connection to the material—a Holmes mega-fan himself, he lends enthusiasm and authenticity to each story, in addition to a personal written introduction. —Michael, Audible Editor

## 29. The Underground Railroad (Oprah's Book Club)

A Novel
By: Colson Whitehead
Narrated by: Bahni Turpin
Length: 10 hrs and 43 mins
Release date: 08-02-16
     4.5 out of 5 stars11,353 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
An important work by any measure, Colson Whitehead’s take on the titular slave escape route is delivered in unvarnished language that lays bare the heinousness of that darkest moment in our history. Bahni Turpin’s narration is at once chilling and subtly evocative as she shifts from slave to brutal slave owner; from depictions of harsh assaults to fleeting, beautiful moments of hope. It’s a listen that’s forever changed my perception of an ugly time I’d previously known primarily from matter-of-fact textbook accounts. —Courtney, Audible Editor

## 30. Pride and Prejudice

By: Jane Austen
Narrated by: Rosamund Pike
Series: Audible's Jane Austen
Length: 11 hrs and 35 mins
Release date: 12-08-15
     5 out of 5 stars12,509 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Experiencing this classic, as performed by Academy Award nominee Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) —who also starred as Jane Bennet in the big screen version of Austen’s beloved novel—is a bucket-list-level essential for all listeners. For me, it’s the ideal coming together of novel and narrator. From her caustic rendition of Mrs. Bennet to the stern Mr. Darcy, Pike brings all of Austen’s tremendous characters to life, proving that she was born to perform this book. —Doug, Audible Editor

## 31. Hidden Figures

The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
By: Margot Lee Shetterly
Narrated by: Robin Miles
Length: 10 hrs and 47 mins
Release date: 09-06-16
     4 out of 5 stars7,186 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
There’s something so essential about the story that Hidden Figures tells. Four incredible mathematicians already had the deck so stacked against them for being women and African American in Jim Crow Virginia, yet they persevered to propel NASA ahead in the great Space Race. When you add narrator Robin Miles’s trademark warmth, rhythm, and pacing to the mix, Hidden Figures becomes even more of a force to be reckoned with. I hope everyone who watched the fantastic movie will take a deep dive into this essential listen. —Rachel, Audible Editor

## 32. The Devil in the White City

Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America
By: Erik Larson
Narrated by: Scott Brick
Length: 14 hrs and 58 mins
Release date: 12-29-02
     4.5 out of 5 stars19,216 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
If you haven't listened to something by Erik Larsson, start with this. This richly detailed, incredibly immersive story juxtaposes the glamour and glitz of the World's Fair with the gruesome acts of one of America's first serial killers. As you listen to Scott Brick subtly switch between the narrative of the serial killer and the narrative of the Chicago architects, it will become obvious why he’s one of my favorite narrators—and he might become one of yours too. —Laura, Audible Editor

## 33. The Book Thief

By: Markus Zusak
Narrated by: Allan Corduner
Length: 13 hrs and 56 mins
Release date: 09-14-06
     4.5 out of 5 stars21,670 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Set in Nazi Germany and narrated by Death, this Printz Award winner is the story of a young orphan who finds solace in books and the love of her adoptive father as the world is going mad all around her. This audiobook packs an emotional punch, leaving me gasping for breath as I pulled off the road because I was sobbing too hard to drive. Be warned and pack tissues, but don’t miss this one! —Sonja, Audible Editor

## 34. The Eye of the World

Book One of The Wheel of Time
By: Robert Jordan
Narrated by: Kate Reading, Michael Kramer
Series: Wheel of Time, Book 1
Length: 29 hrs and 57 mins
Release date: 12-31-06
     4.5 out of 5 stars32,350 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series is not only an essential listen because of its sheer magnitude and importance in the fantasy genre: it's perhaps one of the most stunning examples of a dual narration out there. Longtime pair Michael Kramer and Kate Reading work in tandem to bring to life Robert Jordan's epic tale over fourteen books that add up to nearly three weeks' worth of audio. And despite all that listening time, with these two, this is an adventure you'll never want to end. —Sam, Audible Editor

## 35. Wonder

By: R. J. Palacio
Narrated by: Diana Steele, Nick Podehl, Kate Rudd
Series: Wonder, Book 1
Length: 8 hrs and 6 mins
Release date: 02-14-12
     4.5 out of 5 stars14,477 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
There’s so much to love about Diana Steele’s raspy representation of 10-year-old Auggie as he faces going from homeschooling to private school with facial deformities that make him the subject of scrutiny, ridicule and yes, often compassion. It drives home the fact that R. J. Palacio’s entire story of family, friends, and inner vs outer beauty, also narrated by Nick Podehl and Kate Rudd, is the kind of uplifting tale we always need, particularly in times such as these. —Abby, Audible Editor

## 36. 1776

By: David McCullough
Narrated by: David McCullough
Length: 11 hrs and 33 mins
Release date: 05-20-05
     4.5 out of 5 stars13,240 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
David McCullough has won the Pulitzer Prize (twice), and qualifies as an essential American historian. 1776 stands as one of his signature achievements in audiobooks (he narrates!), a classic of leadership and history. I love 1776 personally because the events of that year—meticulously but suspensefully narrated—take place so often in and around the NY/NJ area. (Curiously, listeners from Boston and Virginia say the exact same thing!) Crossing the Delaware is not to be missed! —Christina, Audible Editor

## 37. Red Rising

By: Pierce Brown
Narrated by: Tim Gerard Reynolds
Series: Red Rising, Book 1
Length: 16 hrs and 12 mins
Release date: 01-28-14
     4.5 out of 5 stars37,051 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
Red Rising is the epic opener to a thrilling and compulsively listenable sci-fi series. I say sci-fi, but actually this is a total genre bender: let’s just call it “post-apocalyptic, dystopian, YA-crossover military sci-fi with Roman history and general awesome geniusness.” All these elements meld together into one whip-smart saga that stayed with me for months after finishing it. —Emily, Audible Editor

## 38. 14

By: Peter Clines
Narrated by: Ray Porter
Series: Threshold Universe
Length: 12 hrs and 34 mins
Release date: 06-19-12
     4.5 out of 5 stars40,278 ratings

Why We Think It's Essential
The collective members of our team have recommended 14 so many times that it feels like a prerequisite course to becoming an Audible Editor. For me, the combination of Peter Clines’s compulsive, creepy mystery and Ray Porter’s pitch-perfect performance of an ensemble of quirky characters (his specialty) provided my “aha” moment as a listener—the realization that an audiobook could not only be a great book in the traditional sense, but an amazing immersive performance that can rival the best TV series or movie. —Sam, Audible Editor

Why We Think It's Essential
This is the first book that made me fall in love with reading, the first to show me that a book can be a portkey to another world. It has everything a magic-loving child could want: an ordinary piece of furniture that transports kids to an enchanted, wintry world, talking animals, a wicked witch, and a great battle of good vs. evil. And Michael York’s rich voice brings Narnia to thrilling, glorious life. —Sonja, Audible Editor

Why We Think It's Essential
George Saunders’s first foray into long-form fiction quickly won critical acclaim, and the 2017 Man Booker Prize. But this is really a book you have to hear. With more than 160 narrators—many of them famous people you probably already know (Nick Offerman, David Sedaris, Carrie Brownstein, Ben Stiller, Susan Sarandon, Don Cheadle, to name a few)—it is really unlike any other audiobook. One-of-a-kind both in form and content, Lincoln in the Bardo is an audio experience that simply washes over you. It will definitely make you laugh and wonder, and it definitely made this Audible Editor take a quick break for a severely unattractive but cathartic cry. —Michael, Audible Editor
