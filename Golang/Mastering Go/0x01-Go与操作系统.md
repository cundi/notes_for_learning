## Go的历史 The history of Go 
Go is a modern, generic-purpose, open source programming language that was officially announced at the end of 2009. Go began as an internal Google project, which means that it was started as an experiment, and has since been inspired by many other programming languages, including C, Pascal, Alef, and Oberon. Go's spiritual fathers are the professional programmers Robert Griesemer, Ken Thomson, and Rob Pike.

They designed Go as a language for professional programmers who want to build reliable, robust, and efficient software. Apart from its syntax and its standard functions, Go comes with a pretty rich standard library.

At the time of writing, the latest stable Go version is version 1.13. However, even if your version number is higher, the contents of the book will still be relevant.

If you are going to install Go for the first time, you can start by visiting https://golang.org/dl/. However, there is a big chance that your UNIX variant has a ready-to-install package for the Go programming language, so you might want to get Go by using your favorite package manager.


## Go将走向何方？ Where is Go going?
The Go community is already discussing the next major version of Go, which is going to be called Go 2, but there is nothing definitive at the moment.

The intention of the current Go 1 team is to make Go 2 more community driven. Although this is a good idea in general, it is always dangerous when lots of people try to make important decisions about a programming language that was initially designed and developed as an internal project by a small group of great people.

Some of the big changes that are being considered for Go 2 are generics, package versioning, and improved error handling. All these new features are under discussion at the moment and you should not be worried about them, but it is worthwhile to have an idea of the direction that Go is going in.

## Go的优点 The advantages of Go

Go具有很多优点，当人们与其他编程语言比较时，你能够发现其中一些优点是Go所独有的，

Go code is portable, especially among UNIX machines.
Go has support for procedural, concurrent, and distributed programming.
Go supports garbage collection, so you do not have to deal with memory allocation and deallocation.
Go does not have a preprocessor and does high-speed compilation. As a consequence, Go can also be used as a scripting language.
Go can build web applications and provides a simple web server for testing purposes.
The standard Go library offers many packages that simplify the work of the developer. Additionally, the functions found in the standard Go library are tested and debugged in advance by the people who develop Go, which means that, most of the time, they come without bugs.
Go uses static linking by default, which means that the binary files produced can be easily transferred to other machines with the same OS. As a consequence, once a Go program is compiled successfully and an executable file is generated, you do not need to worry about libraries, dependencies, and different library versions anymore.
You will not need a graphical user interface (GUI) for developing, debugging, and testing Go applications, as Go can be used from the command-line, which I think many UNIX people prefer.
Go supports Unicode, which means that you do not need any extra code for printing characters from multiple human languages.
Go keeps concepts orthogonal because a few orthogonal features work better than many overlapping ones.


Go优点和特性中最重要的几个如下所列：

- Go是一种现代的编程语言，它易于阅读和理解，而且它是由实际开发经验的开发者所编写。
- Go想让开发者感到快乐，因为快乐的开发者会写出更好的代码！
- Go编译器所打印的实际警告和错误消息有助于你解决真正的问题。简单来说，Go编译器的存在是帮助用户的，而不是通过打印无意义输出把你搞得心理难受。
- Go的代码具有可移植性，特别实在Unix机器中。
- Go支持面向过程、并行和分布式编程
- Go支持`垃圾回收`，所以你不必处理内存的分配和释放。
- Go没有`预处理器`，并且高速编译。由此，Go还可以被用作脚本语言。
- Go能够构建web应用，而且提供了基于测试目的的简单web服务器。
- Go的标准库提供了很多简化开发者工作的库。此外，Go标准库中的函数是由开发Go的人所调测的，这也就是说，基本上这些函数是不会有bug的。
- Go默认使用静态链接，这意味着二进制文件的生成可以轻易地转换到具有相同操作系统的其他机器上。由此可知，只要Go程序编译成功，其二进制文件就随之生成，你就再也不需要担心库、依赖，以及其他库的版本问题了。
- 你将不需要图形界面来开发和调测Go应用，Go能够在命令行中使用，我想这也是很多Unix用户的优选。
- Go支持Unicode，它可以让不用任何额外的代码来打印人类的多种语言。
- Go一直秉承“垂直”概念，因为少量的“垂直”特性好过多个相互重叠特性。

### Go是完美的吗？
There is no such thing as the perfect programming language, and Go is not an exception to this rule. However, some programming languages are better at some areas of programming or we like them more than other programming languages. Personally, I do not like Java, and while I used to like C++, I do not like it anymore. C++ has become too complex as a programming language, whereas, in my opinion, Java, code does not look good.

Some of the disadvantages of Go are:

- Go does not have direct support for object-oriented programming, which can be a problem for programmers who are used to writing code in an object-oriented manner. Nevertheless, you can use composition in Go to mimic inheritance.

- For some people, Go will never replace C.
- C is still faster than any other programming language for systems programming and this is mainly because UNIX is written in C.

Nevertheless, Go is a pretty decent programming language that will not disappoint you if you find the time to learn it and program in it.

#### 什么事预处理器？

I said earlier that Go does not have a preprocessor and that this is a good thing. A preprocessor is a program that processes your input data and generates output that will be used as the input to another program. In the context of programming languages, the input of a preprocessor is source code that will be processed by the preprocessor before being given as input to the compiler of the programming language.

之前我就说过，Go没有预处理器，这也是件好事。

The biggest disadvantage of a preprocessor is that it knows nothing about the underlying language or its syntax! This means that when a preprocessor is used, you cannot be certain that the final version of your code will do what you really want because the preprocessor might alter the logic as well as the semantics of your original code.
The list of programming languages with a preprocessor includes C, C++, Ada, and PL/SQL. The infamous C preprocessor processes lines that begin with # and are called directives or pragmas. As stated before, directives and pragmas are not part of the C programming language!

### The godoc utility
The Go distribution comes with a plethora of tools that can make your life as a programmer easier. One of these tools is the godoc utility, which allows you to see the documentation of existing Go functions and packages without needing an internet connection.

The godoc utility can be executed either as a normal command-line application that displays its output on a terminal, or as a command-line application that starts a web server. In the latter case, you will need a web browser to look at the Go documentation.

>#### Tips
>If you type godoc without any command-line parameters, you will get a list of the command-line options supported by godoc.

The first way is similar to using the man(1) command, but for Go functions and packages. So, in order to find information about the Printf() function of the fmt package, you should execute the following command:

```bash
   $ go doc fmt.Printf
```

Similarly, you can find information about the entire fmt package by running the following command:

```bash
$ go doc fmt
```

The second way requires executing godoc with the -http parameter:

```bash
 $ godoc -http=:8001
```

The numeric value in the preceding command, which in this case is 8001, is the port number the HTTP server will listen to. You can choose any port number that is available provided that you have the right privileges. However, note that port numbers 0-1023 are restricted and can only be used by the root user, so it is better to avoid choosing one of those and pick something else, provided that it is not already in use by a different process.

You can omit the equal sign in the presented command and put a space character in its place. So, the following command is completely equivalent to the previous one:

```bash
   $ godoc -http :8001
```

After that, you should point your web browser to the http://localhost:8001/pkg/ URL in order to get the list of available Go packages and browse their documentation.

## 编译Go代码

In this section, you will learn how to compile Go code. The good news is that you can compile your Go code from the command line without the need for a graphical application. Furthermore, Go does not care about the name of the source file of an autonomous program as long as the package name is main and there is a single main() function in it. This is because the main() function is where the program execution begins. As a result, you cannot have multiple main() functions in the files of a single project.

本小结中，你讲学习如何编译Go代码。好消息是你可以在命令行中编译代码，而不需要用到图形应用。进一步来说，Go不关心自治程序的源文件名，因为包的名字一直都是`main`，而文件中就只有一个`main()`函数。这是因为`main()`函数是程序执行的起点。因此，你不能够在一个文件中使用多个`main()`函数。

We will start our first Go program compilation with a program named aSourceFile.go that contains the following Go code:



```go
/* aSourceFile.go */
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("This is a sample Go program!")
}
```

执行命令，创建可执行文件：

```bash
go build aSourceFile.go
```

执行，可执行文件：

```shell
$ ./aSourceFile
This is a sample Go program!
```

## 执行Go代码

运行而不用手动创建可执行文件

```shell
$ go run aSourceFile.go
This is a sample Go program!
```

本书主要使用go run执行示例代码。
go run比go build更简单，此外，go run在执行执行完成后不会在硬盘留下任何文件。

## 两个原则

- 要么使用Go包，要么不导入

理由：执行的Go代码中包含导入未使用的包时会保存，程序终止

示例1，导入`fmt` `os`而不调用：

```go
/* packageNotUsed.go */
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello there!")
}
```

执行结果：

```bash
$ go run packageNotUsed.go
# command-line-arguments
./packageNotUsed.go:5:2: imported and not used: "os"
```

示例２，

```go
/* packageNotUsedUnderscore.go */
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    _ "os"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello there!")
}
```

执行结果.

```shell
$ go run packageNotUsedUnderscore.go
Hello there!
```

- 格式化大括号的唯一方法

```go
/* curly.go */
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main()
{
    fmt.Println("Go has strict rules for curly braces!")
}
```

执行代码会遇到syntax error消息

```shell
$ go run curly.go
# command-line-arguments
./curly.go:7:6: missing function body for "main"
./curly.go:8:1: syntax error: unexpected semicolon or newline before
{
```

go在很多上下文中要求使用分号作为语句终止符，而编译器则会自动地添加这个分号。

## 引用外部包

```go
/* getPackage.go */
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(simpleGitHub. AddTwo (5, 6))
}
```

直接执行上面的代码会报错

```shell
$ go run getPackage.go
getPackage.go:5:2: cannot find package
"github.com/mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub" in any of:
/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.9.1/libexec/src/github.com/
mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub (from $GOROOT)
/Users/mtsouk/go/src/git
```

正确的方法是先将外部包下载到本地，然后再执行代码

```shell
$ go get -v github.com/mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub
github.com/mactsouk/go (download)
github.com/mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub
```

```shell
$ go run getPackage.go
11
```

删除下载外部包时的中间文件

```shell
$ go clean -i -v -x github.com/mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub
cd /Users/mtsouk/go/src/github.com/mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub
rm -f simpleGitHub.test simpleGitHub.test.exe
rm -f /Users/mtsouk/go/pkg/darwin_amd64/github.com/mactsouk/
go/simpleGitHub.a
```

删除下载的完整Go包：

```shell
-> go clean -i -v -x github.com/mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub
-> rm -rf ~/go/src/github.com/mactsouk/go/simpleGitHub
```

## Unix标准输入，输入出，和错误

```go
/* printing.go */
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)
func main() {
    v1 := "123"
    v2 := 123
    v3 := "Have a nice day\n"
    v4 := "abc"
    fmt.Print(v1, v2, v3, v4)
    fmt.Println()
    fmt.Println(v1, v2, v3, v4)
    fmt.Print(v1, " ", v2, " ", v3, " ", v4, "\n")
    fmt.Printf("%s%d %s %s\n", v1, v2, v3, v4)
}
```

fmt.Print() 和 fmt.Println()之间的区别：

- 每次调用时后者会自动添加一个新行字符

fmt.Println() 和 fmt.Printf()之间的最大区别是：

- 后者要求格式化元字符，其类似于Ｃ语言的printf函数。

执行结果：

```shell
$ go run printing.go
123123Have a nice day
abc
123 123 Have a nice day
abc
123 123 Have a nice day
abc
123123 Have a nice day
abc
```

## 使用标准输出

## 获取用户输入

## 关于 := 和 =

`:=`的官方名称叫做“快捷赋值语句”

对已声明变量使用`:=`，将抛出错误：

```shell
$ go run test.go
# command-line-arguments
./test.go:5:4: no new variables on left side of :=
```

```go
i, k := 3, 4
j, k := 1, 2
```

### 读取标准输入

```go
/*  stdIN.go  */
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    var f *os.File
    f = os.Stdin
    defer f.Close()

    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(f)
    for scanner.Scan() {
        fmt.Println(">", scanner.Text())
    }
}
```

bufio包很多时候用于文件输入和输出

执行：

```shell
$ go run stdIN.go
21
> 21
This is Mihalis!
> This is Mihalis!
```

### 使用命令行参数

```go
/*  cla.go */
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strconv" // 将字符串转换为数字类型
)

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) == 1 {
        fmt.Println("Please give one or more floats.")
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    arguments := os.Args
    min, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(arguments[1], 64)
    max, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(arguments[1], 64)

    for i := 2; i < len(arguments); i++ {
        n, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(arguments[i], 64)
        if n < min {
            min = n
        }
        if n > max {
            max = n
        }
    }

    fmt.Println("Min:", min)
    fmt.Println("Max:", max)
}
```

`os.Args`是一个拥有String类型值的`Slice`。
所以arguments这个slice的第一个元素是可执行程序的名称，而第二个元素则是
下划线字符`_`，被称为`空标识符`，是Go中表示丢弃值的一种方法。

执行：

```shell
-> go run cla.go -10 0 1
Min: -10
Max: 1
-> go run cla.go -10
Min: -10
Max: -10
```

```shell
$ go run cla.go a b c 10
Min: 0
Max: 10
```

## 错误输出

```go
/* stdOUT.go */
package main 

import (
    "io"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    myString := ""
    arguments := os.Args
    if len(arguments) == 1 {
        myString = "Please give me one argument!"
    } else {
        myString = arguments[1]
    }

    io.WriteString(os.Stdout, "This is Standard output\n")
    io.WriteString(os.Stderr, myString)
    io.WriteString(os.Stderr, "\n")
}
```

执行：

```shell
$ go run stdERR.go
This is Standard output
Please give me one argument!
```

将上面执行代码的标准错误写到文件：

```shell
$ go run stdERR.go 2>/tmp/stdError
This is Standard output
$ cat /tmp/stdError
Please give me one argument!
```

忽略标准错误：

```shell
$ go run stdERR.go 2>/dev/null
This is Standard output
```

忽略标准错误同时写文件：

```shell
$ go run stdERR.go >/tmp/output 2>&1
$ cat /tmp/output
This is Standard output
Please give me one argument!
```

同时将标准输出和标准错误写到/dev/null:

```shell
-> go run stdERR.go >/dev/null 2>&1
```

## 写日志文件

使用log的syslog包

### 日志等级

debug, info, notice, warning, err, crit, alert, and emerg

### logging facility 日志设施

### 日志服务器

### 发送信息到日志文件的示例

```go
/*  logFiles.go */
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "log/syslog"
    "os"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    programName := filepath.Base(os.Args[0])
    sysLog, err := syslog.New(syslog.LOG_INFO|syslog.LOG_LOCAL7, programName)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    } else {
        log.SetOutput(sysLog)
    }
    log.Println("LOG_INFO + LOG_LOCAL7: Logging in Go!")

    sysLog, err = syslog.New(syslog.LOG_MAIL, "Some program!")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    } else {
        log.SetOutput(sysLog)
    }

    log.Println("LOG_MAIL: Logging in Go!")
    fmt.Println("Will you see this?")
}
```

执行输出如下：

```shell
$ go run logFiles.go
  
Broadcast message from systemd-journald@mail (Tue 2017-10-17 20:06:08
EEST):

logFiles[23688]: Some program![23688]: 2017/10/17 20:06:08 LOG_MAIL:
Logging in Go!

Message from syslogd@mail at Oct 17 20:06:08 ...
Some program![23688]: 2017/10/17 20:06:08 LOG_MAIL: Logging in Go!
Will you see this?
```
