# 异步编程

Beside the sequential and parallel execution models, there is a third model that is of
fundamental importance together with the concept of event programming: the asynchronous
model.

The execution model of asynchronous tasks can be implemented through a single main
control flow, both in single-processor systems and in multiprocessor systems. In
the concurrent asynchronous execution model, the executions of various tasks intersect
along the timeline, and everything happens under the action of a single flow of control
(single-threaded). Once started, the execution of tasks can be suspended and then resumed
over time, alternating with the execution of other current tasks that are present.

The development of code for the asynchronous model is completely different from that for
multithreaded programming. A substantial difference between the concurrent
multithreaded parallel model and the single-threaded concurrent asynchronous model lies
in the fact that, in the first case, the OS decides on the timeline if we suspend the activity of
one thread and start another.

This remains outside the control of the coder, unlike the asynchronous model. The
execution or termination of a task continues as long as it is explicitly required.
The most important feature of this type of programming is that the code is not performed
on multiple threads, as in the classic concurrent programming, but on a single thread. Thus,
it is not at all true that two tasks are executed at the same time, but, according to this
approach, they are performed at almost the same time.

## concurrent.futures模块的使用

concurrent.futures模块由两个主要类构成：

- Executor: 这是一个提供了异步地执行调用的抽象基类。
- Future:　封装了异步的可执行对象的执行过程。

该模块还提供了两个Executor的子类，分别异步地操作线程池和进程池：

- concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers)
- concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers)

Because the instantiation of threads and processes is a resource　demanding task, it is better to pool these resources and use them as repeatable launchers or
executors (hence the Executors concept) for parallel or concurrent tasks.

因为线程或者进程的实例化是一个即时资源任务，最好是将这些资源放到池中，而这些资源可以在并行或者并发任务的需求下被重复运行或者执行。

The approach we are taking here involves using a pool executor. We will submit the assets
to the pool (thread and process) and get the futures, which are the results that will be
available to us in the future. Of course, we can wait for all futures to become real results.

我们在这里用到方法涉及到执行器的使用。我们会把资源提交到池中（线程和进程），然后取得future，即，可以让我们在之后可以被调用的结果。当然，我们也可以等待所有future都变为真正的结果。

A thread or process pool (also called pooling) indicates a management software that is being
used to optimize and simplify the use of threads and/or processes within a program.



Through pooling, you can submit the task (or tasks) in order to execute them to the pooler.
The pool is equipped with an internal queue of tasks pending and several threads or
processes that execute them. A recurring concept in pooling is reusing: a thread (or process)
is used several times for different tasks during its life cycle. This decreases the overhead of
creating new threads or processes and increases the performance of the program.

通过入池（pooling），由执行需要时你可以提交一个或多个任务。这个池子是由一个挂起任务的内部队列所组成，。入池中所反复强调的概念是重复使用：一个线程（或者进程）在其生命周期中

Reuse is not a rule, but it is one of the main reasons that lead a coder to use pooling in their
application.

重复使用并不是规定，但这也是让编程者在程序中使用入池(pooling)的一个主要原因。

we have a list of 10 elements. Each element of the list
is made to count up to 100,000,000 (just to waste time), and then the last number is
multiplied by the i-th element of the list. In particular, we are evaluating the following
cases:
Sequential execution
Thread pool with five workers
Process pool with five workers

我们定义一个10元素列表。列表中的每个元素都加到100,000,000（只为了消耗更时间），然后最后一个数乘以列表中第ｉ个元素。
下面这段代码按顺序执行，使用了五个线程，五个进程。

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

number_list = list(range(1, 11))


def count(number):
    for i in range(0,100000000):
        i += 1
        return i*number


def evaluate(item):
    result_item = count(item)
    print('Item %s, result %s' % (item, result_item))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    start_time = time.clock()
    for item in number_list:
        evaluate(item)
        print('Sequential Execution in %s seconds' % (time.clock() -　start_time))
        start_time = time.clock()
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as　executor:
            for item in number_list:
                executor.submit(evaluate, item)
                print('Thread Pool Execution in %s seconds' % (time.clock() -　start_time))
                start_time = time.clock()

        with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as　executor:
            for item in number_list:
                executor.submit(evaluate, item)
                print('Process Pool Execution in %s seconds' % (time.clock() -　start_time))
```

Note that both the thread and process pools are set with max_workers=5;
moreover, if max_workers is equal to None, it will default to the number
of processors on the machine.

注意线程池和进程池都设定为5，此外，如果max_workers等于None，那么该参数的默认值等于机器的cpu核心数。

```shell
Item 1, result 10000000
Item 2, result 20000000
Item 3, result 30000000
Item 4, result 40000000
Item 5, result 50000000
Item 6, result 60000000
Item 7, result 70000000
Item 8, result 80000000
Item 9, result 90000000
Item 10, result 100000000
Sequential Execution in 6.8109448 seconds
Item 2, result 20000000
Item 1, result 10000000
Item 4, result 40000000
Item 5, result 50000000
Item 3, result 30000000
Item 8, result 80000000
Item 7, result 70000000
Item 6, result 60000000
Item 10, result 100000000
Item 9, result 90000000
Thread Pool Execution in 6.805766899999999 seconds
Item 1, result 10000000
Item 4, result 40000000
Item 2, result 20000000
Item 3, result 30000000
Item 5, result 50000000
Item 6, result 60000000
Item 7, result 70000000
Item 9, result 90000000
Item 8, result 80000000
Item 10, result 100000000
Process Pool Execution in 4.166398899999999 seconds
```

It should be noted that although the example is not expensive in computational terms,
sequential and thread pool execution are comparable in terms of time. Using a process pool
gives us the fastest execution time.

应该注意的是，尽管这个例子中并没有在计算周期上有过多的消耗，顺序执行和线程池执行的执行周期是相似的。使用进程池让我们拥有最少的执行时间。

The pool then distributes the processes (in this case, five processes) between the available
cores (for this example, a machine with four cores was used) in FIFO (short for first in, first
out) mode.



So, for each core, the assigned process runs in series. Only after the I/O operation is
performed does the pool schedule the execution of another process. Of course, the
execution mechanism is the same if you use a thread pool.

所以就每个核心来说，分配进程以顺序运行。

The computational times, which are lower in the case of the process pool, must be traced
back to the fact that I/O operations are not significant. This allows the pool of processes to
be faster because, unlike threads, they do not require any synchronization mechanisms.




## 使用asyncio管理事件循环

该模块的主要组件如下：

- Event loop: The asyncio module allows one event loop per process. This is the
entity that deals with managing and distributing the execution of different tasks.
In particular, this registers the tasks and manages them by switching the control
flow from one task to another.　

asyncio模块允许每个进程运行一个事件循环。这是一个管理和分发不同任务执行的实体。特别是，这个事件循环注册

- Coroutines: This is a generalization of the concept of the subroutine. Also, a
coroutine can be suspended during execution to wait for external processing
(some routine in I/O) and return from the point it had stopped at when the
external processing is done.　

这是一个广义上的子程序概念。而且，协程可以在需要等待外部执行（I/O）时挂起，而且可以在外部执行完成时从其停止的地方返回内容。

- Futures: This defines the Future object exactly like the concurrent.futures
module. It represents a computation that has still not been accomplished.

这里定义的Future对象，完全和concurrent.futures的一样。它表示计算还未完成。

- Tasks: This is a subclass of asyncio that is used to encapsulate and manage
coroutines in a parallel mode.　

### 理解事件循环

In computer science, an event is an action intercepted by the program that can be managed
by the program itself. As an example, an event could be the virtual pressure of a key by the
user during interaction with the graphical interface, the pressure of a key on the physical
keyboard, an external interrupt signal, or, more abstractly, the reception of data through the
network. But more generally, any other form of event that has happened that can be
detected and managed in some way.

Within a system, the entity that can generate events is called an event source, while the entity
that deals with handling an event that occurs are an event handler.
The event loop programming construct realizes the functionality of managing events within
a program. More precisely, the event loop acts cyclically during the whole execution of the
program, keeping track of events that have occurred within a data structure to queue and
then process them one at a time by invoking the event handler if the main thread is free.

The pseudocode of the event loop manager is shown here:

事件循环管理器的伪代码如下

```shell
while (1) {
    events = getEvents()
    for (e in events)
        processEvent(e)
}
```

All the events that are fed into the while loop are caught and then processed by the event
handler. The handler that processes an event is the only activity taking place in the system.
When the handler has ended, control passes to the next event scheduled.

所有while循环中的事件都被捕获，然后被事件处理器所处理。

使用以下方法管理事件循环：

loop = get_event_loop(): This gets the event loop for the current context.
loop.call_later(time_delay,callback,argument): This arranges for the
callback to be called after the given time_delay, in seconds.
loop.call_soon(callback, argument): This arranges for a callback to be
called as soon as possible. The callback is called after call_soon() (https:/​/
docs.​python.​org/​3/​library/​asyncio-​eventloop.​html) returns when control
returns to the event loop.
loop.time(): This returns the current time as a float value (https:/​/​docs.
python.​org/​3/​library/​functions.​html), according to the event loop's internal
clock.
asyncio.set_event_loop(): This sets the event loop for the current context to
loop.
asyncio.new_event_loop(): This creates and returns a new event loop object
according to this policy's rules.
loop.run_forever(): This runs until stop() (https:/​/​docs.​python.​org/​3/
library/​asyncio-​eventloop.​html) is called.
