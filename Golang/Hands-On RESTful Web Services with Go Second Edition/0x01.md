# Getting Started with REST API Development

## Setting up the project and running the development server

Make sure you have done the following things before proceeding:
Install the Go compiler on your machine
Set the GOROOT and GOPATH environment variables

It is a common practice to create a project under the home directory and set the GOPATH
environment variable as follows:

```bash
mkdir /home/user/workspace
export GOPATH=/home/user/workspace
```

Now, we install external packages like this:

```bash
go get -u -v github.com/gorilla/mux
```

Let's understand this structure before digging further:
bin : Stores the binary of our project; a shippable binary that can be run directly
pkg : Contains the package objects; a compiled program that supplies package
methods
src : The place for your project source code, tests, and user packages
